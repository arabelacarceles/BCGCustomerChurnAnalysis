# 🔁 Customer Churn Analysis x BCG 

A data-driven project aimed at understanding and reducing **customer churn in the insurance industry** using predictive modeling and strategic recommendations.  
📊 Developed as part of the *Business Challenge I* module in the Master’s in Business Analytics at Hult International Business School, in collaboration with **Boston Consulting Group (BCG)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The challenge involved working with a synthetic dataset and a mobile insurance app prototype provided by BCG. The objective was to:
- Detect patterns of customer churn.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Recommend actionable strategies to improve customer retention.

The final output included exploratory insights, predictive models, and a strategy presentation for executive stakeholders.

## Steps to Reproduce
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Required Python libraries 
- Jupyter Notebook for running the analysis.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/BusinessChallengeI.git
   ```
2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
   - Use the Jupyter notebook `MBAN_Team4_BusinessChallenge.ipynb` to explore and clean the dataset.
3. **Review Results:**
   - Refer to the `reports/` folder for the presentation and supporting analysis.

## Key Deliverables
1. **Data Insights:**
   - Identified key churn drivers such as late payments and customer complaints.
2. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Applied logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest algorithms to predict churn.
   - Models struggled with accuracy due to the synthetic nature of the dataset.
3. **Strategies:**
   - Developed actionable strategies to reduce churn, including:
     - Automated alerts for missed payments.
     - Gamified engagement and loyalty programs.
     - Improved onboarding and claims processing.
